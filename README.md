# Installation
To install this application simply clone this repository to your local; However You will need to have access to the Dotnet 5 development suit, and a database to connect to. Once you are set up with Dotnet 5 and have a database connected, run the seed data in the root folder. Then run the application starting inside the UI project folder.

# Usage
This application is useful mostly for new developer that want to see a basic C# Dotnet application run. If you are interested I would suggest trying to get the application working in your local environment and then trying to create your own store.
